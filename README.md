# rgb_3d_reconstruction_pipeline

To help to learn the 3d reconstruction from rgb input, here I give sdk and lib to help you make a textured mesh from only rgb images from the traditional methods.

## TODO
- [X] Unreleased Pipeline with colmap and openmvs
- [ ] Released Pipeline for Colmap and openMVS as a library.
- [ ] Combine Poisson Reconstruction.

## Architectures
### Sparse Reconstruction


## Samples
- [X] DTU-scan1
- [ ] GoPro
- [ ] Binocular Stereo
- [ ] Phone Camera
