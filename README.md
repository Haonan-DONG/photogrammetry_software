# rgb_3d_reconstruction
To help to learn the 3d reconstruction from rgb input, this tool is developed to help you make a textured mesh from only rgb images (currently) by the traditional methods.

## TODO
- [X] Unreleased Pipeline with COLMAP and OpenMVS
- [ ] Released Pipeline for COLMAP and openMVS as a library. From rgb input into textured mesh.
- [ ] Combine Poisson Reconstruction.
- [ ] Add keyframe abstraction from SLAM-Based algorithm.
- [ ] ACMM Re-coding.

## Samples
- [X] DTU-scan1
- [ ] GoPro
- [ ] Binocular Stereo
- [ ] Phone Camera
