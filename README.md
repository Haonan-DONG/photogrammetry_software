# rgb_3d_reconstruction
## Purpose
- A handy pipeline to make a textured mesh from rgb images (currently) by the traditional methods.
- Reproduce the latest methods.


## TODO
- [X] Released Pipeline for COLMAP and openMVS as a library. From rgb input into textured mesh.
- [ ] Combine Poisson Reconstruction.
- [ ] Add keyframe abstraction from SLAM-Based algorithm.
- [ ] ACMM Re-coding.

## Samples
- [X] DTU-scan1
- [ ] GoPro
- [ ] Binocular Stereo
- [ ] Phone Camera
